# AI / Machine Learning Experiments

🚧 This repository is currently a work in progress.

## Overview

This repository contains experiments focused on integrating Machine Learning workflows with cloud-native infrastructure and automation.

The objective is to build scalable, production-style ML pipelines rather than isolated notebooks.

---

## Goals

- Build automated data preprocessing pipelines
- Implement model training workflows
- Integrate infrastructure provisioning via Terraform
- Automate deployment using CI/CD pipelines
- Add monitoring and observability

---

## Planned Architecture

Data Source → Preprocessing → Model Training → Model Storage → API Deployment → Monitoring

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Data ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Training automation script
- [ ] Containerized ML model (Docker)
- [ ] CI/CD integration
- [ ] Cloud deployment (AWS / Azure / GCP)
- [ ] Logging & metrics

---

## Why This Project

This repository reflects my interest in combining:
- Infrastructure as Code
- DevOps automation
- Cloud engineering
- AI/ML workflows

The focus is on building scalable and reproducible ML systems aligned with production engineering practices.
